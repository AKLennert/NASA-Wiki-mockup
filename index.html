            The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is
            an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for
            the United States's civil space program, aeronautics research and
            space research. Established in 1958, it succeeded the National
            Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the American space
            development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing
            peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most of
            America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury,
            Project Gemini, the 1968–1972
            <a href="/Apollo.html">Apollo program</a>
            missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle.
            Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station (ISS) along
            with the Commercial Crew Program and oversees the development of the
            Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis
            program.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <h3 id="creation">Creation</h3>
          <p>
            NASA traces its roots to the National Advisory Committee for
            Aeronautics (NACA). Despite Dayton, Ohio being the birth place of
            aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far
            behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American
            leadership in aviation, the United States Congress created the
            Aviation Section of the US Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established
            NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over
            the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in
            support of the US Air Force, US Army, US Navy, and the civil
            aviation sector. After the end of World War II, NACA became
            interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic
            aircraft, developing and testing the Bell X-1 in a joint program
            with the US Air Force. NACA's interest in space grew out of its
            rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            Launch of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Explorer 1, America's
            first satellite The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 ushered in
            the Space Age and kicked off the Space Race. Despite NACA's early
            rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first
            American satellite fell to the Naval Research Laboratory's Project
            Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured the Army Ballistic
            Missile Agency would launch Explorer 1, America's first satellite,
            on February 1, 1958.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eisenhower Administration decided to split the United States's
            military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized
            together under the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
            Projects Agency. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the
            signing of the National Aeronautics and Space Act and it began
            operations on October 1, 1958.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            As the American's premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core
            of NASA's new structure by reassigning 8,000 employees and three
            major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval
            Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army's Jet Propulsion
            Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency under
            Wernher von Braun. This left NASA firmly as the United States's
            civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead.[5]
          </p>
          <h3 id="first-orbital-and-hyperonic-flights">
            First orbital and hyperonic flights
          </h3>
          <p>
            Plans for human spaceflight began in the US Armed Forces prior to
            NASA's creation. The Air Force's Man in Space Soonest project formed
            in 1956,[6] coupled with the Army's Project Adam, served as the
            foundation for Project Mercury. NASA established the Space Task
            Group to manage the program,[7] which would conduct crewed
            sub-orbital flights with the Army's Redstone rockets and orbital
            flights with the Air Force's Atlas launch vehicles. While NASA
            intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President
            Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. The
            Mercury 7 astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy
            aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to enter
            space, performing a suborbital spaceflight in the Freedom 7.[8] This
            flight occurred less than a month after the Soviet Yuri Gagarin
            became the first human in space, executing a full orbital
            spaceflight. NASA's first orbital spaceflight was conducted by John
            Glenn on February 20, 1962, in the Friendship 7, making three full
            orbits before reentering. Glenn had to fly parts of his final two
            orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction.[9] The sixth and
            final Mercury mission was flown by Gordon Cooper in May 1963,
            performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in the Faith 7.[10] The Mercury
            Program was wildly recognized as a resounding success, achieving its
            objectives to orbit a human in space, develop tracking and control
            systems, and identify other issues associated with human
            spaceflight.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            While much of NASA's attention turned to space, it did not put aside
            its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to
            build upon the X-1's supersonic flight to build an aircraft capable
            of hypersonic flight. The North American X-15 was a joint NASA–US
            Air Force program,[11] with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming
            the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to
            outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program
            technologies, as well as ramjet and scramjet propulsion.[5]
          </p>
          <h3 id="moon-landing">Moon landing</h3>
          <p>
            Escalations in the Cold War between the United States and Soviet
            Union prompted President John F. Kennedy to charge NASA with landing
            an American on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end
            of the 1960s and installed James E. Webb as NASA administrator to
            achieve this goal.[12] On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy openly
            declared this goal in his "Urgent National Needs" speech to the
            United States Congress, declaring:
          </p>
          <div id="quote">
            <p>
              I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
              before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and
              returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this
              period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for
              the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult
              or expensive to accomplish.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Kennedy gave his "We choose to go to the Moon" speech the next year,
            on September 12, 1962 at Rice University, where he addressed the
            nation hoping to reinforce public support for the Apollo
            program.[13]
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon from
            the former president Dwight Eisenhower and 1964 presidential
            candidate Barry Goldwater, President Kennedy was able to protect
            NASA's growing budget, of which 50% went directly to human
            spaceflight and it was later estimated that, at its height, 5% of
            Americans worked on some aspect of the Apollo program.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            Mirroring the Department of Defense's program management concept
            using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental
            ballistic missiles, NASA requested the Air Force assign Major
            General Samuel C. Phillips to the space agency where he would serve
            as the director of the Apollo program. Development of the Saturn V
            rocket was led by Wernher von Braun and his team at the Marshall
            Space Flight Center, derived from the Army Ballistic Missile
            Agency's original Saturn I. The Apollo spacecraft was designed and
            built by North American Aviation, while the Apollo Lunar Module was
            designed and built by Grumman.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            To develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar
            mission, NASA initiated Project Gemini.[14] Using a modified Air
            Force Titan II launch vehicle, the Gemini capsule could hold two
            astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini pioneered the use
            of fuel cells instead of batteries, and conducted the first American
            spacewalks and rendezvous operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ranger Program was started in the 1950s as a response to Soviet
            lunar exploration, however most missions ended in failure. The Lunar
            Orbiter program had greater success, mapping the surface in
            preparation for Apollo landings, conducting meteoroid detection, and
            measuring radiation levels. The Surveyor program conducted uncrewed
            lunar landings and takeoffs, as well as taking surface and regolith
            observations.[5] Despite the setback caused by the Apollo 1 fire,
            which killed three astronauts, the program proceeded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit
            and the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited
            the Moon ten times on December 24 and 25, 1968, and then traveled
            safely back to Earth.[15][16][17] The three Apollo 8
            astronauts—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders—were the
            first humans to see the Earth as a globe in space, the first to
            witness an Earthrise, and the first to see and manually photograph
            the far side of the Moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first lunar landing was conducted by Apollo 11. Commanded by
            Neil Armstrong with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins,
            Apollo 11 was one of the most significant missions in NASA's
            history, marking the end of the Space Race when the Soviet Union
            gave up its lunar ambitions. As the first human to step on the
            surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong uttered the now famous words:
          </p>
          <div id="quote">
            <p>That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            NASA would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the Apollo
            program, with Apollo 17 concluding the program in 1972.[5]
          </p>
          <h3 id="end-of-apollo">End of Apollo</h3>
          <p>
            Wernher von Braun had advocated for NASA to develop a space station
            since the agency was created. In 1973, following the end of the
            Apollo lunar missions, NASA launched its first space station,
            Skylab, on the final launch of the Saturn V. Skylab reused a
            significant amount of Apollo and Saturn hardware, with a repurposed
            Saturn V third stage serving as the primary module for the space
            station. Damage to Skylab during its launch required spacewalks to
            be performed by the first crew to make it habitable and operational.
            Skylab hosted nine missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and
            deorbited in 1979, two years prior to the first launch of the Space
            Shuttle and any possibility of boosting its orbit.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1975, the Apollo–Soyuz mission was the first ever international
            spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the Cold
            War rivals, which also marked the last flight of the Apollo
            capsule.[5] Flown in 1975, a US Apollo spacecraft docked with a
            Soviet Soyuz capsule.
