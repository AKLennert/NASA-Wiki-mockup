            The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is
            an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for
            the United States's civil space program, aeronautics research and
            space research. Established in 1958, it succeeded the National
            Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the American space
            development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing
            peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most of
            America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury,
            Project Gemini, the 1968–1972
            <a href="/Apollo.html" class="hyperlink">Apollo program</a>
            missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle.
            Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station (ISS) along
            with the Commercial Crew Program and oversees the development of the
            Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis
            program.

            's science division is focused on better understanding Earth through
            the Earth Observing System; advancing heliophysics through the
            efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research
            Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced
            robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons and planetary rovers such as
            Perseverance; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big
            Bang, through the James Webb Space Telescope, the four Great
            Observatories, and associated programs. The Launch Services Program
            oversees launch operations for its uncrewed launches.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            NASA traces its roots to the National Advisory Committee for
            Aeronautics (NACA). Despite Dayton, Ohio being the birth place of
            aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far
            behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American
            leadership in aviation, the United States Congress created the
            Aviation Section of the US Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established
            NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over
            the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in
            support of the US Air Force, US Army, US Navy, and the civil
            aviation sector. After the end of World War II, NACA became
            interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic
            aircraft, developing and testing the Bell X-1 in a joint program
            with the US Air Force. NACA's interest in space grew out of its
            rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            Launch of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's Explorer 1, America's
            first satellite The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 ushered in
            the Space Age and kicked off the Space Race. Despite NACA's early
            rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first
            American satellite fell to the Naval Research Laboratory's Project
            Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured the Army Ballistic
            Missile Agency would launch Explorer 1, America's first satellite,
            on February 1, 1958.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eisenhower Administration decided to split the United States's
            military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized
            together under the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
            Projects Agency. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the
            signing of the National Aeronautics and Space Act and it began
            operations on October 1, 1958.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            As the American's premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core
            of NASA's new structure by reassigning 8,000 employees and three
            major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval
            Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army's Jet Propulsion
            Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency under
            Wernher von Braun. This left NASA firmly as the United States's
            civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead.[5]
