            The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the United
            States human spaceflight program led by
            <a href="/index.html">NASA</a>, which landed the first humans on the
            Moon in 1969.[2] Apollo was conceived during Project Mercury and
            executed after Project Gemini. It was conceived in 1960 as a
            three-person spacecraft during the Presidency of Dwight D.
            Eisenhower. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F.
            Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon
            and returning him safely to the Earth" in an address to Congress on
            May 25, 1961.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission, when
            astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar
            Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while
            Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service
            module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific
            Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed
            astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In
            these six spaceflights, twelve people walked on the Moon.

            Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon Buzz Aldrin (pictured)
            walked on the Moon with Neil Armstrong, on Apollo 11, July 20–21,
            1969. NASA Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle Earthrise, the iconic 1968
            image from Apollo 8 taken by astronaut William Anders Apollo ran
            from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It
            encountered a major setback in 1967 when the Apollo 1 cabin fire
            killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first Moon
            landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on
            landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical
            exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these.
            Five of the remaining six missions achieved landings; but the Apollo
            13 landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded en route
            to the Moon, crippling the CSM. The crew barely managed a safe
            return to Earth by using the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" on the
            return journey. Apollo used the Saturn family of rockets as launch
            vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program,
            which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three
            crewed missions in 1973–1974, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a
            joint United States-Soviet Union low Earth orbit mission in 1975.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands
            alone in sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8
            was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and
            Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.
            Overall, the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar
            rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding
            of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid
            the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability
            and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy
            Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of
            technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight, including
            avionics, telecommunications, and computers.

          <h2>Name</h2>
          <p>
            The program was named after Apollo, the Greek god of light, music,
            and the Sun, by NASA manager Abe Silverstein, who later said, "I was
            naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby."[3] Silverstein chose
            the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt "Apollo
            riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale
            of the proposed program".[4]
          </p>
          <p>
            The context of this was that the program focused at its beginning
            mainly on developing an advanced crewed spacecraft, the Apollo
            command and service module, succeeding the Mercury program. A lunar
            landing became the focus of the program only in 1961.[5] Thereafter
            Project Gemini instead followed the Mercury program to test and
            study advanced crewed spaceflight technology.

          <p>
            The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower
            administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to Project Mercury.
            While the Mercury capsule could support only one astronaut on a
            limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible
            missions included ferrying crews to a space station, circumlunar
            flights, and eventual crewed lunar landings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden announced the
            Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of Space Task
            Group conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a
            spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command
            module (piloting and reentry cabin), and a propulsion and equipment
            module. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced,
            and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to General
            Dynamics/Convair, General Electric, and the Glenn L. Martin Company.
            Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies
            led by Maxime Faget, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the
            three industry designs.[6]
          </p>
          <h3 id="Political">Political pressure builds</h3>
          <p>
            In November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a
            campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in
            the fields of space exploration and missile defense. Up to the
            election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the "missile
            gap" that he and many other senators said had developed between the
            Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President
            Eisenhower.[7] Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace
            technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US
            not "first but, first and, first if, but first period".[8] Despite
            Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the
            status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew
            little about the technical details of the space program, and was put
            off by the massive financial commitment required by a crewed Moon
            landing.[9] When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James
            E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency,
            Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program
            but deferred a decision on the broader issue.[10]
          </p>
          <p>
            On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first
            person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left
            behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a
            meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one
            day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support
            for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch
            up.[11] Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news,
            refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the
            Soviets.[12]
          </p>
          <p>
            On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B.
            Johnson, asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space
            program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to
            catch up.[13][14] Johnson responded approximately one week later,
            concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving
            results necessary if this country is to reach a position of
            leadership."[15][16] His memo concluded that a crewed Moon landing
            was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States
            would achieve it first.[15]
          </p>
          <p>
            On May 25, 1961, twenty days after the first American crewed
            spaceflight Freedom 7, Kennedy proposed the crewed Moon landing in a
            Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs:
          </p>
          <div id="quote">
            <p>
              Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new
              American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading
              role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to
              our future on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              ... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving
              the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon
              and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in
              this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important
              in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so
              difficult or expensive to accomplish.[17][a]
